# matrixchainmultiplication

Given N number of matrices along with the dimensions of each one. Your task is       to find the minimum scalar multiplication using dynamic programming.
In the input section, the first line provides the number of matrices followed by their dimensions of N+1 values separated by a space in the next line.
In the output section,
a)Display cost matrix
b)Matrix order table
c)Ordering of the matrices with proper  parenthesization
d)Optimal scalar cost
